# Title: Hotel Room Booking System

Whether or not a hotel room booking system should accept a request from user depends on factors:
1. Whether there is at least one hotel that are available based on user’s preferred date
2. Whether there is at least one hotel that are available based on user’s preferred place
3. Whether the user fill in all details and submit the information for booking confirmation
4. Whether the user pay for the booked room

The program runs by asking the user whether their input is true for all states.  If the user answers yes, the program will run through a loop to validate the input strings and prints out the input is correct. Otherwise, the program will go through validation and stops when they encounter a false statement and goes into the trap state.
